### Purpose

The goal of this assignment is to learn some techniques to improve the visual quality of a given image.  

You are given an image of size M Ã— N pixels, with k bits used for the intensity resolution.  

The image may be very dark or very bright and can be 
improved if we can redistribute the intensities to span a wider range of intensities than are being used.

### Histogram Matching and Equalization

There are several techniques for image enhancement. Histogram equalization is a technique to enhance the visual quality of
the above types of images. Histogram equalization automatically determines a transformation function which is applied on the
input image to produce an image that has an approximately uniform histogram. An image with a uniform histogram shows a
great deal of detail and high dynamic range.

In some application domains, uniform histogram-based image enhancement may not be appropriate. In such applications, a
user specifies the shape of the histogram desired for the processed image. The method used to generate an output image with
the specified histogram from an input image is called histogram specification/histogram matching.

### Usage

```
Usage: histo.exe [params] imagefile outdir histogram_file

        -h, --help (value:true)
                show help message
        -m, --mode (value:1)
                1 = Histogram Equalization [default]
                2 = Histogram Matching an Image
                3 = Historgram matching a file

        imagefile (value:<none>)
                input image
        outdir (value:./out)
                output directory
        histogram_file (value:<none>)
                file for histogram matching

```
